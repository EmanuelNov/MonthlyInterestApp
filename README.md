# MonthlyInterestApp
This is a simple app which allows the user to calculate the monthly interest given to a sum of money. First the user adds the amount of money, an interest rate, 
then a time period (number of months) which after pressing the "kalkulo" button returns the installment and the total amount paid after the installments
